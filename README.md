# STROKE PREDICTION

## Overview
The goal of this project is to develop an effective model for predicting the likelihood of strokes in individuals within a healthcare dataset
## Dataset
Dataset used from Kaggle Website
[Dataset link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)

Description about Features :

|3)|age| The age of the individual|
|4)|hypertension| Whether the individual has hypertension (1 if true, 0 if false)|
|5)|heart_disease| Whether the individual has heart disease (1 if true, 0 if false)|
|6)|ever_married| Whether the individual has ever been married (Yes/No)|
|7)|work_type| The type of work the individual is involved in (e.g., Private, Self-employed)|
|8)|Residence_type|The type of residence of the individual (Urban/Rural)|
|9)|avg_glucose_level| The average glucose level in the individual's blood|
|10)|bmi|The Body Mass Index (BMI) of the individuals|
|11)|smoking_status| The smoking status of the individual (e.g., formerly smoked, never smoked)|
|12)|stroke|The target variable indicating whether the individual had a stroke (1 if true, 0 if false|
